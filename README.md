# Temperature-Controlled-Fan-System
## Overview
This project presents a temperature-controlled automatic fan system developed using Arduino. The system automatically regulates fan speed based on ambient temperature, eliminating the need for manual control.

## Aim
To design and implement an automated fan system that adjusts its speed according to surrounding temperature conditions.

## Working Principle
The temperature sensor reads real-time ambient temperature. The Arduino Uno processes the input and controls the DC fan speed using PWM signals through a transistor driver circuit. Different temperature ranges correspond to different fan speeds.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LM35 / DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- DC Motor (Fan)
- Transistor Driver Circuit
- LEDs
- Power Supply

## Features
- Automatic temperature-based control
- Multi-level fan speed regulation
- LED status indication
- Real-time environment testing
